# Kabunga Workout

A personal gym companion app I built for myself — designed to make my actual workouts faster and smarter.

## What it does

Kabunga is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that acts as your real-time workout guide in the gym.

- **Plan before you go**: Add your exercises (warmup, main lifts, cooldown), set the number of sets, reps, and weight for each one
- **Guided session**: When you tap Start, it walks you through one exercise at a time — you just do the work and tap Next
- **Bodyweight-friendly**: Exercises like push-ups, breathing drills, or stretches don't need a weight — just leave it blank
- **Rest timer**: Counts down between sets so you don't have to guess when to go again
- **Full history**: Every session is saved so you can look back at what you've done
- **Works offline**: You can use it at the gym even without a signal
